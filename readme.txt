Created an HTML5 Game App Centipede as per the Assignment Outline in Moodle.

## Synopsis
---------------
Created a Centipede Game using HTML5, CSS, and javascript.
In the game, a centipede is coming down towards the player, and the main motive of the player is to stop the centipede to come downwards by shooting it and progressing with the level. There are mushrooms located on random points of the map which the centipede can collide with and come down faster.
The player can shoot the mushroom as well as the centipede.

Used the p5.js library for the development.
