I created an HTML5 game app, Centipede, per the Assignment Outline in Moodle.

## Synopsis
---------------
I created a Centipede Game using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
In the game, a centipede is coming down towards the player, and the player's main motive is to stop the centipede from coming downwards by shooting it and progressing with the level. There are mushrooms on random points of the map that the centipede can collide with and come down faster.
The player can shoot the mushroom as well as the centipede.

Used the p5.js library for the development.
